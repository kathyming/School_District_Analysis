# School_District_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to see if there a correlation between test scores and school budget, or school size, or school type.  In order to better analyze the data it was necessary to remove the scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School due to evidence that some of the scores were altered. 
## Results
### District Summary
Removing the unvalidated 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School from the data frame appears to have little to no effect on the district summary scores.
